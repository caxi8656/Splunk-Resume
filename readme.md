# Randomly Generated Art

Catherine Xie

This program uses the random module to generate two sets of five circles in random places and animated them 
using turtle grpahics. Three black circles will be animated after the randomly-generated circles. The color 
of the five sets of circles is based of the IBM's color palette of the colorblind as to ensure colorblind 
individuals can clearly differentiate the circle colors.
